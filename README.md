# Custom-Visualizations
Plotted bar plot along with confidence level of 95% for each bar's mean. As the values get overlapped and it becomes difficult of get the proper value, have implemented a colorbar normalised between 0-1. There is a moving horizontal line which moves as we click on the Y axis(proximity of 5% within plot allowed). Depending weather the value chose from Y axis lies in confidence interval the colors of the bar change according to the gradient of colorbar. Below the confidence interval the color is always dark blue and above it the color is always dark red.
